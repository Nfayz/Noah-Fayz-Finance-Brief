    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This week's edition of The Noah Fayz Finance Brief explores market fluctuations tied to inflation surprises, Q1 earnings from top firms, global macro policy shifts, and strategic positioning moving forward.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="market" class="section">
    <h2>Market Overview</h2>
    <p>The S&P 500 ended the week slightly lower after midweek volatility sparked by stronger-than-expected CPI numbers. Investors rotated out of high-growth tech and into defensive sectors, with healthcare and utilities outperforming. Treasury yields climbed, weighing on rate-sensitive assets. The Nasdaq showed resilience thanks to AI-driven sentiment, while small caps lagged.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="earnings" class="section">
    <h2>Earnings Highlights</h2>
    <p>Big tech continued to deliver. Apple beat EPS on strong services growth but showed flat iPhone revenue. Amazon outperformed expectations with advertising strength. AMD surprised to the upside in its data center business. Banks were mixed, with JPMorgan exceeding expectations but regional banks showing signs of funding pressure.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="macro" class="section">
    <h2>Macro Trends</h2>
    <p>The Fed held rates steady, citing mixed data. CPI rose 0.4% MoM and core inflation remained sticky. Job growth exceeded forecasts, keeping rate cut bets subdued. Abroad, China showed weak manufacturing PMI, while the ECB signaled caution on rate normalization. Energy prices dipped, contributing to volatility in commodities.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="strategy" class="section">
    <h2>Strategy & Outlook</h2>
    <p>Current positioning favors a balanced barbell strategy â€” combining growth with low-volatility sectors. Consider increasing exposure to quality names in technology and healthcare, while remaining cautious of rate-sensitive areas. Upcoming economic data (PCE, ISM) and earnings from key retailers will likely steer sentiment next week.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="conclusion" class="section">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Markets remain driven by inflation, central banks, and corporate earnings. Staying informed and adaptive is critical. Expect continued choppiness with windows of opportunity in specific sectors.</p>
