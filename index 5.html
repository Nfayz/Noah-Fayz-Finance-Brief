    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This week, inflation surprises, mixed corporate earnings, and renewed uncertainty around Federal Reserve policy drove significant volatility across markets. In this issue, we break down the signals, cut through the noise, and show you where the smart money is headed.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="market" class="section">
    <h2>Market Overview</h2>
    <p>The S&P 500 edged lower, shedding 0.5% for the week, as investor focus shifted toward bond yields and macroeconomic risk. The Nasdaq outperformed slightly thanks to strength in semiconductors and large-cap AI names like NVIDIA.</p>
    <p><strong>Sector Rotation:</strong> Defensive plays in utilities and healthcare gained traction while discretionary sectors lagged. Energy prices declined, dragging oil majors lower.</p>
    <img src="charts/sp500-weekly.png" alt="S&P 500 Weekly Chart">
    <p>Yields on the 10-year Treasury topped 4.6%, pressuring equities and spooking rate-sensitive sectors. Meanwhile, breadth weakened — fewer stocks are leading the rally as traders grow cautious ahead of next week’s PCE data.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="earnings" class="section">
    <h2>Earnings Highlights</h2>
    <p><strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong> beat expectations on services growth, but flat iPhone revenue kept bulls tempered. The company announced a $110B stock buyback, providing near-term support.</p>
    <p><strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong> saw robust cloud stabilization and explosive advertising growth, propelling a strong beat across metrics. Margin expansion is back in focus for analysts.</p>
    <p><strong>AMD</strong> exceeded guidance in its data center segment. However, weakness in PC demand held back forward guidance. Analysts remain bullish on long-term AI hardware tailwinds.</p>

  </div>

  <div id="macro" class="section">
    <h2>Macro Trends</h2>
    <p>The April CPI rose 0.4%, reigniting fears that inflation will remain sticky through the summer. Shelter and services continue to drive core readings higher.</p>
    <p>Job growth exceeded expectations with 253K new payrolls, keeping rate cut expectations muted. Fed speakers reiterated a data-driven stance and indicated patience.</p>
    <p>Globally, weak Chinese exports (-3.2% YoY) and ECB dovishness set the tone abroad. Oil slipped 1.5% despite geopolitical tension in the Middle East.</p>

  </div>

  <div id="strategy" class="section">
    <h2>Strategy & Outlook</h2>
    <p>Investors should favor high-quality growth with strong cash flow and balance sheet strength. Dollar-cost averaging into AI infrastructure, healthcare, and industrials offers a tactical edge.</p>
    <p>Short-duration bonds and money market exposure remain attractive. Expect a choppy summer driven by inflation data and policy tone shifts.</p>

  </div>

  <div id="conclusion" class="section">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This week reminded us that while narratives change quickly, the underlying drivers remain. Stay anchored in data, and remember: volatility creates opportunity for those prepared.</p>
    <p>Catch you next Friday with the latest market edge — same time, same place.</p>
